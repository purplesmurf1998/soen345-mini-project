                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>The covid-19 pandemic has affected a lot of people these past few years. One of these effects is that people spend more time in front of computers screens now more than ever. People are also moving a lot less due to a lot of team sports and activities being put on pause.</p>
                    <p>Because of lockdowns happenning across multiple countries, people are limited to working out and exercising at home by using multiple apps to track their workouts, macros, screen activity and other aspects of their health. This can be very confusing and result in even more screen activity.</p>

                <div id="current-situation-div">
                    <h1>The Current Situation</h1>
                    <p>Right now there are endless apps on the market that can tracks multiple spects of your life. This can range from you screen activity, sleep cycle, workouts, macros, and much more. The problem with this is that by needing to constantly switch from one app to the other, this indirectly results in an increase of screen activity. It can also become very confusing and unmotivating needing to keep track of all these apps. Not to mention all the different notifications someone can receive daily since these different health apps don't communication with eachother. </p>
                    <p><u>Imagine 5 professors giving you 5 exams on the same day, it can get overwhelming!</u></p>

                    <h1>Our Proposed Situation</h1>
                    <p>Now after reading all this, imagine if that didn't need to be the case! What we propose is a simple, easy to use, centralized application that does all of the above all into one. A HealthSuperApp. This app contains all the functionalities of the most used health apps on the market all in one place so that users can now find their information a lot easier. Decreasing managing time will allow the user to focus on their actual health and decrease the amount of time they spend on their phones or tablets. Every app communicates with eachother and properly spaces out notifications so that the user doesn't get bombarded. Trainers can connect their clients and track their progression. This is the future of health apps!</p>

                <div id="research-div">
                    <h1>Research</h1>
                    <p>In order to fully understand user needs and frustrations, some research needed to be done. The main form of data collection used were surveys sent out to various demographics ranging from young teenagers to the more elderly. The goal was really to get an idea of which demographics would benefit the most from a health super app and what we could do to improve their experience with out app.</p>
                    <p>From our data we found that most people did in fact have more than one health app on their phones.</p>

                    <p>And from this data we can see that most people either only use 1 of their health apps or none at all.</p>
